            Semester-long group assignment for SOEN 287 (Web Programming) at Concordia University.
            Learned and used HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP.
            Designed and developed a grocery store website with the following criteria:<br>
            Users to browse products organized by aisles.
            Users can add different products to their cart.
            Users can create an account and log in to make their purchase.
            Customer, product, and order data must be held in a database.
            Admin must be able to edit customer, product, and order data in the back store<br>
