          Built the classic Battleship game using OOP concepts.A console version
          of the game of Battleship played against the computer on a single 8 by
          8 grid. This simplified version of the game will be played on a single
          8 by 8 grid. Before the actual game, each player secretly places 6
          ships and 4 grenades on the grid. Ships and grenades are a single
          position on the grid. The position of these ships and grenades are of
          course hidden from the opponent. Once both players have placed their
          ships and grenades, the actual game starts. Each player, in turn,
          “shoots a rocket” on the grid (i.e. calls a position).
          <br />
          <br />
          - If the rocket (the position called) falls on a position where there
          is nothing, then nothing happens, and the other player can shoot
          his/her rocket.
          <br />
          <br />
          - If the rocket falls on a coordinate where the opponent (or the
          player) has a grenade, then the player loses a turn, and next time,
          the opponent will play twice in a row.
          <br />
          <br />
          - If the rocket falls on a coordinate where the opponent (or the
          player...) has a ship, then that ship sinks.

          <br />
          <br />
          - If the rocket falls on a coordinate that has been called before,
          regardless of what was there before, nothing happens. (So, for
          example, a grenade can only explode once). The goal of the game is to
          sink all of your opponent’s ships before your opponent sinks yours.
